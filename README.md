# Vertigo
A minigame for Spigot-based Minecraft servers. An original concept from [cavetale.com](https://cavetale.com).

In Vertigo, players take turn in jumping from vertigo-inducing heights into a pool of water. If you hit a water block it's filled in with a solid block and you gain points. The more difficult jumps gain even more points.
The game ends when a player has a lead of 10 points or when the pool has been filled in with blocks.

## Info for players
You join in spectator mode, only switching to adventure mode when it's your turn to jump.

You can't eat, break blocks, pick up items, drop items, interact with stuff or use elytra. It's ALL about using your skills to make those jumps.

**It's recommended you empty your inventory before joining. You shouldn't die, but better be safe than sorry.**

### Here's how you earn points
1 point for passing through a golden ring, no matter what.
+2 points if you land in water.

1 point if you land in water.
+1 point for every filled-in block adjacent to the one you landed in.

The absolute max number of points you can get for a single jump is 8; passing through a golden ring, landing in a water block surrounded by 4 filled-in blocks. Are you up for the challenge?

There is a 50% chance a golden ring will spawn at the start of every "round". In an average game you should see a fair amount of golden rings.

### You win..
If you have a 10 point lead at the start of a "round".

If you have the most points when all water blocks have been filled in.

If you are the only player left in the game (everyone else quit).

### How to join a game
When you're notified a game has been set up, you simply join by clicking the "join" button in chat, or you can just enter **/vertigo**.

### How to leave a game
Simply teleport away, using /spawn, /home or whatever.

**Note: when you leave the game world, you're out of the game. If you join again, you'll only be able to spectate.** (Until a new game starts)
